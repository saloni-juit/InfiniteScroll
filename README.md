To run :
Just open index.html to run the application.

For posting of edited data : Since, http://requestb.in/1ip251a1?inspect does not support CORS POST requests(https://github.com/Runscope/requestbin/issues/17) , I am using http://httpbin.org/, It sends the sent data in the response which is being reflected in the main page.
